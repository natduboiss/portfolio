<h2>Parallax Web Scroll</h2>
<div class="grid">
  <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2">
    <h4>Goal</h4>
    <p>Create a webpage and animate this page to mimic a parallax scrolling feature of a web page. It should use multiple layers which seem to move at different speeds to create a sensation of depth and an interesting browsing experience.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2">
    <h4>Insight</h4>
    <p>The examples that I saw online about parallax web scrolling were all above ground scrolling into the ground. I wanted to do it a bit differently and use the sea. As you scroll further down the page you would go deeper in the depths of the water, discovering new things.</p>

    <h6>Storyboard</h6>
    <p>I sketched out the different levels of the waters for the scrolling effect.</p>

  <h6>Problems</h6>
  <p>I discovered a problem when animating in after effect. I would import all my illustrator layers but some of the last ones wouldn't show. I had to open a new illustrator file and create and save them individually to have them in after effects. I also had alot of trouble with making the scrolling effect look seamless but with lots of hours playing around with the 3D camera in AE I managed the look of scrolling down the page.</p>

    <h6>Typeface</h6>
    <p>I decided to use the type face Futura because it is very clean and easy to read.</p>

  <h6>Final logo</h6>
  <p>The original logo had the colour orange to it, which I didn't mind leaving. I was thinking about using a brown because the the meats they sell but the orange was a more better option because it makes the logo stand out.</p>
