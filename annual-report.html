      <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">The goal was to create an annual report for World Animal Protection with just a word document of text. As well as create one infograph in the annual report.</p>

      <h4 class="insight push-0 pad-b-1-4">Insight</h4>
      <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">I created a clean and clear annual report that represented the brand of the business it represents. I encountered a problem while printed, since I miss calculated the number of pages I needed. However it was easily fixed as I had extra pages in case of this problem happening.</p>

      <h4 class="push-0 pad-b-1-4">Step 2: Moodboard</h4>
      <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">I researched the brand by looking on their website and they used the font Futura Round for all their text. I also realized the colours they use are orange, black and white. After reading the text I was given, I realized they help with all sorts of animals around the world, which you will see in the final pictures of my annual report I added plenty of animals from around the world.</p>

      <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">I really enjoy the final result and had a great time designing everything from the graphs, the graphics and the layout of the whole annual report. I also really enjoyed playing around with the hierachy.</p>
