        <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">The goal was to create an annual report for World Animal Protection with just a word document of text. As well as create one infograph in the annual report.</p>

        <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">I created a clean and clear annual report that represented the brand of the business it represents. I encountered a problem while printed, since I miss calculated the number of pages I needed. However it was easily fixed as I had extra pages in case of this problem happening.</p>

        <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">I started off by doing some quick sketches about how I wanted to layout the text I was given for this assignment. The biggest struggle was to make all the information given, flow nicely on every page and not make it seem like the pages are over cluttered with text.</p>

        <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">I researched the brand by looking on their website and they used the font Futura Round for all their text. I also realized the colours they use are orange, black and white. After reading the text I was given, I realized they help with all sorts of animals around the world, which you will see in the final pictures of my annual report I added plenty of animals from around the world.</p>
