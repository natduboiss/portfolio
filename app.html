        <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">The first step was to research the market. We research the market history, the conpetitors that we would go against, our target audience and demographic, etc. After our research plan was completely we created a questionnaire that we would use to interview our target audience with. After getting some answers with the interviews we created a research report with all of the data we collect.</p>

        <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">After the research was completed we moved on to sketch out our app prototype. Once the sketches were finalized we brought it in to Adobe XD and started building our interactive prototype. After these steps were completeted, it was time to test the app, which was done by doing a focus group.</p>
