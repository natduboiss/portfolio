        <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">I found slightly different logos for this business. When I first saw the logos I immediately started writing what needed changes. The banner needed to go it was very distracting. The type needed to be changed it was too hard to read. The overall logo needed to be more simple and more modern.</p>
