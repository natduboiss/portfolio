<h2>La Maison du rôti</h2>

    <h4>Goal</h4>
    <p>Completely re-design a logo for a company of my choice that's not currently designed very well.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2">
    <h4>Insight</h4>
    <p>My goal was to re-design the logo with a simple and modern approach. I wanted people to look at the logo and immediately understand the business.</p>

  <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2">
    <h6>Current logo</h6>
    <p>When I first saw the logo I immediately started writing where needed changes. The banner needed to go it was very distracting. The type needed to be changed it was too hard to read. The overall logo needed to be more simple and more modern.</p>

    <h6>Typeface</h6>
    <p>I decided to use the type face Futura because it is very clean and easy to read.</p>

  <h6>Final logo</h6>
  <p>The original logo had the colour orange to it, which I didn't mind leaving. I was thinking about using a brown because the the meats they sell but the orange was a more better option because it makes the logo stand out.</p>
