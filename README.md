Natacha Dubois, Graphic Designer

Hi, I’m Natacha Dubois. I’m a graphic designer in the Ottawa region. I’m in my last year of the graphic design program at Algonquin College. I’m also bilingual.

As a designer I take on every project by firstly analyzing the goal, then create an innovative and meaningful solution for everyone. Growing up I've always had a passion for illustrations, I also love Disney movies. I remember drawing many Disney characters and getting complimented on my drawings. That's when I knew I had a true talent in illustrations.

Getting older I was ready for a new challenge so I took on painting. I wanted paintings to put up in my room but the stores never had prints I would truly love, so I would paint my own.

While in the graphic design program, I discovered a passion in web design and motion graphics. I have a strong passion in problem solving, this is what feeds my love for web and motion. Getting your code right and your website working beautifully is the most satisfying thing in the world to me. I can't wait to see what future challenges I will encounter.
