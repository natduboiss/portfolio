    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi, I’m Natacha Dubois. I’m a graphic designer in the Ottawa region. I’m in my second year of the three year  graphic design program at Algonquin College. I’m also bilingual.</p>
    <p>I’ve always had a passion for illustrations. Over the two years being in this program I discovered a passion in web design. I have a strong passion in problem solving but making things pretty comes to a close second. As a designer I take on every project by firstly analyzing the objective, then create an innovative and meaningful solution.</p>
