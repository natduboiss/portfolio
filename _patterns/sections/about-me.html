    <p class="micro gutter-1-2 push-0 pad-b-1-2">Bonjour, I’m Natacha Dubois. I’m a graphic designer in Ottawa. I recently graduated from the graphic design program at Algonquin College. I’m also bilingual.</p>
    <p class="micro gutter-1-2">My biggest passion is illustration. However being in the program I discovered a love for web design as well. I have a strong passion in problem solving but making things pretty comes to a close second. As a designer I take on every project by firstly analyzing the objective, then create an innovative and meaningful solution.</p>
