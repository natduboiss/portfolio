        <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">Working on the design of a complete website, specifically an eCommerce website. Taking the approach of making a pattern library, where each week we’ll be designing different components of the website. In the second half of the project we’ll take all those common components and use them to build out a home page, and a product list page</p>

        <h4 class="push-0 pad-b-1-4">Step 1: Planning</h4>
        <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">I started making a moodboard to inspire the look of the entire site. I wanted the text to be strong and bold throughout and the images and text colour to represent the ocean. I moved on to working more on how the website would flow. I designed the layout of every page and every screensize for the website I was building.</p>

        <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">I quickly sketched out some wireframes to invision how my website would look like for all the different screen sizes. The wireframes we're a very important step, since it helps to code the website when I can tell where I want each component of the website to be.</p>

        <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">Apart of this project was to work with a pattern library. In my opinion, using a pattern library is very useful. It's easier to create a component of your website. It also keeps your code so much cleaner, it's less overwhelming to look at.</p>

        <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">The first step was to research the brand. I went on the website to find how it looks like and what I wanted to change. The website was already quite simple but I wanted to further enhance that but still make the website appealing.</p>
