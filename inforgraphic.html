      <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">Working on the design of a complete website, specifically an eCommerce website. Taking the approach of making a pattern library, where each week we’ll be designing different components of the website. In the second half of the project we’ll take all those common components and use them to build out a home page, and a product list page</p>

      <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">The first step was to research the brand. I went on the website to find how it looks like and what I wanted to change. The website was already quite simple but I wanted to further enhance that but still make the website appealing.</p>
