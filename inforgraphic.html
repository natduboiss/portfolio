      <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">The subject that was given to me was The Growth of Allotments. I wanted the infographic to not feel too overcrowded with words that it's difficult to follow.

      <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">I wanted this infograhic to implement an earthy colour palette. I also had the idea from one of the pictures on the moodboard about the infograph having the design of going deeper in the ground as you make your way down the page.</p>
