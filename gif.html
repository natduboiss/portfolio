      <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">I got inspired by this gif I saw online and with the halloween spirit. I wanted to make a clever gif that can easily loop seamlessly. Sadly I can't upload my gif on vimeo, however this is the video of my gif without it looping and without it being cropped down the the ideal size.</p>
