<h2>Ottawa Dog Rescue</h2>
<div class="grid">
  <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2">
    <h4>Goal</h4>
    <p>Completely re-design an animal rescue website that I found online thatâ€™s not currently designed very well.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2">
    <h4>Insight</h4>
    <p>My goal was for the website to be easy for the users to follow. I wanted to keep it very simple but still carry the information that is necessary without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

    <h6>Step 1: Research</h6>
    <p>The first step was to research the brand. I went on the website to find how it looks like and what I wanted to change. The website was already quite simple but I wanted to further enhance that but still make the website appealing.</p>

    <h6>Step 2: Planning</h6>
    <p>After I was done doing the research I moved on to moodboards. Moodboards helped me visualize the website I was envisioning. Helping find the right colour palettes and the right fonts. Along with which components I wanted to add. When this was all planned I moved to doing wireframes. This helped over see the layout of the website I wanted to create.</p>

    <h6>Step 3: Final Result</h6>
    <p>After the wireframes were all planned out, I moved on to Atom to start coding.</p>
