      <h4 class="push-0 pad-b-1-4">Goal</h4>
      <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">To completely re-design an animal rescue website that I found online thatâ€™s not currently designed very well.</p>

      <h4 class="push-0 pad-b-1-4">Insight</h4>
      <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">My goal was for the website to be easy for the users to follow. I wanted to keep it very simple but still carry the information that is necessary without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

      <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">The first step was to research the brand. I went on the website to find how it looks like and what I wanted to change. The website was already quite simple but I wanted to further enhance that but still make the website appealing.</p>

      <h4 class="push-0 pad-b-1-4">Step 2: Planning</h4>
      <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">After I was done doing the research I moved on to moodboards. Moodboards helped me visualize the website I was envisioning. Helping find the right colour palettes and the right fonts. Along with which components I wanted to add. When this was all planned I moved to doing wireframes. This helped over see the layout of the website I wanted to create.</p>
