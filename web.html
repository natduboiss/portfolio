        <p class="push-0 pad-b-1-4 milli">After I was done doing the research I moved on to moodboards. Moodboards helped me visualize the website I was envisioning. Helping find the right colour palettes and the right fonts. Along with which components I wanted to add. When this was all planned I moved to doing wireframes. This helped over see the layout of the website I wanted to create.</p>
